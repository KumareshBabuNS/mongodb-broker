. Checkout the MongoDB service broker (this repo) from github
* *Option 1:* Import the .pivotal artifact in mongodb-broker/tile/product/releases to your Ops Manager (tested on and works on Version 1.6.9+) and set up your MongoDB configuration
* *Option 2:* Build yourself: requires link:http://cf-platform-eng.github.io/isv-portal/tile-generator/[Tile Generator] installed

Import the newly created .pivotal artifact from mongodb-broker/tile/product/releases to your Ops Manager (tested on and works on Version 1.6.9+) and set up your MongoDB configuration as usual

. Create security group needed by the tile config (you can override this if you wish by flipping the flag in tile.yml)

$ cf create-security-group all_open tile/release/src/templates/all_open.json

. Use OpsManager to configure and deploy the tile
