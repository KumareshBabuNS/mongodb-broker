$ tile init
$ tile build

Import the newly created .pivotal artifact from mongodb-broker/tile/product/releases to your Ops Manager (tested on and works on Version 1.6.9+)

. Create security group needed by the tile config (you can override this if you wish by flipping the flag in tile.yml)
+
----
$ cf create-security-group all_open tile/release/src/templates/all_open.json
----

. Use OpsManager to configure and deploy the tile
